Longhorn 4074 version 2.0 visual style for WindowsXP by KoL

Theme based on Longhorn build 4074 by Microsoft.
Package contains seven different themes, Slate, Jade, Plex, Aero, Athens, Atenas and DWM with normal and thin taskbar. Seven wallpapers, Longhorn icons, User Pictures, Fonts and top shellstyles.

Longhorn Slate: Almost identical to Longhorn theme except inactive windows and start button. The start button used is the one when the sidebar is active. 
Longhorn Jade: Almost identical to Longhorn theme the only things that I changed was the startbutton, the blue fonts are a little darker than the original theme and inactive windows.
Longhorn Aero: My version of Aero.
Longhorn Athens and Atenas: An Aero mod based on screenshot of Athens PC Concept found on winsupersite.com
Longhorn Plex: My Plex version.
